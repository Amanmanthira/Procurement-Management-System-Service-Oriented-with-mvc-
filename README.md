## 🧩 System Workflow

- **Admin Actions**: Admins create and manage quotations, users, and products in the system.
- **Supplier Actions**: Suppliers respond to quotations, manage their inventory, and track their accepted quotations.
- **Quotation Flow**: Quotations are initiated by admins and responded to by suppliers, ensuring efficient communication and documentation.
- **Receipt Generation**: Both suppliers and admins can generate modern, downloadable receipts for their records.

## 🧩 System Architecture
### The system follows a Model-View-Controller-Service (MVC-S) architecture, which combines the traditional MVC design pattern with Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) principles.

- **Model:** Represents the data layer, interacting with the database. Each module (e.g., users, products, quotations) has its own model.
- **View:** Represents the user interface (UI), built using React to render and display data.
- **Controller:** Contains the logic for processing user requests, interacting with models, and returning responses.
- **Service Layer:** This is where Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) comes in. It introduces a separation between business logic and the other layers, allowing each component to work independently and communicate via APIs.
